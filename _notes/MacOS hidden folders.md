> [!fail] I can't locate this hidden folder or file in MacOS Finder!
> If you're programming on a Mac, you may find yourself editing files that are hidden in Finder. For example, I use [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com) at work to manage data transformation jobs, and there is a configuration file that lives in a hidden file which I store at `.dbt/profiles.yml`. Ordinarily I just access it via the command line and edit it via a text editor there, but it is possible to make it appear in Finder, too.
