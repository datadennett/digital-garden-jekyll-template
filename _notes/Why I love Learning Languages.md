title: Why I Love Learning Languages
---
[[Language learning|Learning a new language]] is a mental challenge that helps keep your mind sharp. 

It's a fun little game: trying to come up with how you might say something in a completely different language, with its own rules.

It also opens up new facets of your personality. You might be diplomatic, witty, and urbane in your native language, and discover a loud, passionate, and direct persona in a new language. 

Every conversation is like a scene of improv, and you get to try on a new personality. In New York: *I'm Nat*; in Paris: *je suis Nathaniel;* in Bologna: *sono Nate;* in Berlin: *ich bin Net;* more recently, I decided to introduce myself to my Japanese tutor using my nickname Nacho. (The alternatives were Nasaniel or Natto, the latter of which unfortunately would be a homophone of [a beloved but pungent Japanese delicacy made of fermented soybeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D).)
