# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

Welcome! I'm Nat Dennett, and this is my digital knowledge garden. Come take a stroll! It's still a little sparse for now, but I'm planting more seeds every day. My hope is that you'll find plentiful fruit to pluck off the vines: ideas you can use about data analysis, business intelligence, and language learning.

<strong>Recently updated notes</strong>

<ul>
  {% assign recent_notes = site.notes | sort: "last_modified_at_timestamp" | reverse %}

    <li>
      {{ note.last_modified_at | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} â€” <a class="internal-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ note.url }}">{{ note.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
