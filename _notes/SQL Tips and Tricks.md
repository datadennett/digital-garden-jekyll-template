I'm no expert in SQL, far from it! But there are a few things I've learned using SQL most every day over the past five years. Pick a topic below: maybe I can save you some trouble in your day-to-day!

Do you know more about these topics? Please reach out!

> [!question] Why do some models need to be encased in CTEs?
> I've noticed that in some especially complex models, with lots of calculations being done at the same time, especially ones that rely on each other, some calculated fields won't populate unless they get migrated to their own CTE. Not sure why that is!
